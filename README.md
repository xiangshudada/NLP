# Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing

Creation of a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites
using the Aylien API.
All that is required from the user is to enter the URL of the
news article to be evaluated. After that, a POST request is
made to the server, that deals with the external API and
returns the results of the Natural Language Processing.

## Run

`$ npm install`
`$ cnpm install node-sass@latest`
`$ npm run build-prod`
`$ npm start`

The web tool can be accessed at localhost:3000

## Test

`$ npm test`

The tests were made using the Jest framework, and
are located at `/src/tests`
